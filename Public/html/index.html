                    <button class="collapsible">Rank 1: Nick Bosa, Edge</button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>School: Ohio State | Year: Junior
                            Bosa has an ideal frame for a 4-3 DE and he is consistently disruptive in every game I've
                            studied. As a pass rusher, he can win with quickness, power and a variety of hand moves. He
                            often incorporates the same swipe/rip/flatten move that his brother Joey has mastered. Nick
                            can convert speed to power and he also flashes some ability to slide inside and rush over
                            the guard. He is stout at the point of attack against the run and he's quick to locate and
                            pursue the football. There are some durability concerns after he underwent season-ending
                            core-muscle surgery this past fall. Bosa isn't as big as his older brother, but I expect
                            similar dominance and production at the NFL level.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="collapsible">Rank 2: Quinnen Williams, DT</button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>School: Alabama | Year: Sophomore (RS)
                            Williams has good size for the position and possesses a rare combination of suddenness,
                            strength and football intelligence. He moved up and down the line of scrimmage in Alabama's
                            defense and was effective at every spot. As a pass rusher, he explodes off the ball,
                            maintains leverage and pushes his opponent into the lap of the quarterback. He also uses a
                            violent club/swim move. Williams is constantly double-teamed, but he still finds a way to
                            generate pressures and sacks. Against the run, he plays with a low pad level, locks his
                            hands inside and violently sheds blocks to pursue the ball carrier. Overall, this is a
                            dominant player who's capable of emerging as a premier interior defensive lineman very early
                            in his NFL career.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="collapsible">Rank 3: Josh Allen, Edge</button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>School: Kentucky | Year: Senior
                            Allen is a tall, long edge player with tremendous agility, versatility and production. As a
                            pass rusher, he wins with speed, bend and a nifty inside counter move. He doesn't possess a
                            lot of power, but makes up for it with his Gumby-like flexibility at the top of his rush.
                            Against the run, he uses his length to set the edge and he's a blur closing from the back
                            side. Allen is a huge asset in coverage, providing the athletic ability to mirror backs and
                            tight ends all over the field. Overall, the Kentucky product possesses an ideal skill set
                            for today's game: He can run, rush and cover.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="collapsible">Rank 4: Rashan Gary, Edge</button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>School: Michigan | Year: Junior
                            Gary is a freak. He has a unique blend of size, speed, explosiveness and power.
                            Unfortunately, it doesn't always translate to production. As a pass rusher, he has a dynamic
                            get-off and flashes the power to bull through OTs with only one arm extended. However, he
                            lacks complementary moves and stalls at the top of his rush far too often. Against the run,
                            he destroys TEs on the edge with pure strength and power. However, he will bury his head and
                            fail to locate the football at times. His athleticism is on display in coverage, where I've
                            seen him run and mirror slot receivers. There are some concerns about his durability after
                            he missed time with injuries. Overall, Gary is more of an athlete than football player at
                            this time, but the upside is off the charts and his effort is exceptional.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="collapsible">Rank 5: Jeffery Simmons, DT</button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>School: Mississippi State | Year: Junior
                            Simmons has the ideal frame, athleticism and explosiveness for the position. As a pass
                            rusher, he has an exceptional first step and rolls his hips to uproot blockers. Simmons has
                            tremendous upper torque to stack and toss blockers on the way to the quarterback. He excels
                            on twists and games. Against the run, he explodes into blocks, extends his arms, peeks and
                            frees himself to make plays. However, teams will need to do their homework on his character
                            -- his 2016 arrest stemmed from a highly publicized video of him getting into a physical
                            altercation with a woman. Overall, Simmons has Pro Bowl potential and a similar skill set to
                            Eagles DT Fletcher Cox.</p>
                    </div>
                    <button class="collapsible">Rank 6: Josh Jacobs, RB</button>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>School: Alabama | Year: Junior
                            Jacobs is one of my favorite players to study in this draft class. He has a thick, compact
                            build and I love his combination of power, elusiveness and versatility. In the run game, he
                            possesses excellent vision, burst and wiggle. His change-of-direction quickness is off the
                            charts. He runs low to the ground and powers through tacklers in every game I studied.
                            Jacobs has the speed to get to the perimeter -- he's a weapon when lined up as a QB in the
                            Wildcat and when he's used on fly sweeps from the slot. In the passing game, Jacobs runs
                            crisp routes, possesses natural hands and he's a make-you-miss specialist in space. He does
                            need to improve in pass protection. He must come to balance as a blocker and avoid lunging
                            at blitzers. Overall, Jacobs is a special talent and his light workload at Alabama (251
                            carries in three seasons) should be viewed as a positive, not a negative.</p>
